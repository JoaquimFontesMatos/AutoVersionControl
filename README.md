Github action workflow to automate semantic versioning and update changelogs and release notes automatically.

To be able to automate the semantic versioning you must start the commits with:

- feat: or fix: and `BREAKING CHANGE`: major change, not backwards compatible
- `feat:` new feature, backwards compatible
- `fix:`fix to a certain feature, backwards compatible
